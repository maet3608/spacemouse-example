An extremely simply example on how to read data from the SpaceMouse
and map it to application dependent commands/actions, e.g.
audio control or control of Autodesk SketchBook.

Code uses 
- [pyautogui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [pywin32](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32)
- [pywinusb](https://github.com/rene-aguirre/pywinusb)

and is limited to Windows.
